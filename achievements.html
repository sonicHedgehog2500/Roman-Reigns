											with multiple Superman punches &amp; Spears. At this point, it would be anyone&apos;s guess as to what would 
											happen next? Then, using his Money In The Bank Contract, Seth Rollins injected himself into the match making this 
											a triple threat. Rollins taking advantage of both exhausted men would drive Lesnar out of the ring before pinning 
											Reigns &amp; becoming champion. Although he was not successful in winning the championship, Reigns did achieve the

										<p class="card-text">
											After several months away from WWE, Roman Reigns made his return at Summerslam with a newfound attitude. Reigns 
											has been absent from WWE since the COVID-19 pandemic began, forcing him to miss out on Wrestlemania in a Universal 
											Championship match versus Goldberg. Upon his return, Reigns made his intentions clear that he wanted the Universal 
											Championship. A triple threat match would be scheduled for the Payback pay per view between Reigns, Strowman 
											&amp; The Fiend for this championship. In the coming weeks, WWE officials focused on having all competitors sign a 
											contract so they would be involved in this matchup. Reigns, however, would not sign this contract until the match 
											took place which already had Strowman &amp; The Fiend laid out having already begun this contest. Taking advantage 
											of the situation, Reigns would brutalise both men further &amp; dethrone The Fiend to win his second Universal 
											Championship.

											Unsuccessful in an opportunity for the inaugural Universal Championship at Summerslam, Roman Reigns set his sights

											United States Championship at Summerslam versus Roman Reigns. Before they&apos;re match could get underway, both 
											men engaged in a brawl all over ringside. As a result, this match never took place. A few weeks later saw Reigns 
											cheated out of a Universal Championship opportunity due to Rusev&apos;s interference. This would lead to both men 
											competing in a United States Championship match at the Clash Of Champions pay per view. In a brutal contest, Reigns 
											would withstand aggression from the champion &amp; outside interference to win his first United States Championship.
