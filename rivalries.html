							The rivalry between Roman Reigns &amp; Brock Lesnar dates to 2015 on the road to Wrestlemania 31. Reigns winning 
							the Royal Rumble match earned his opportunity to challenge for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship versus Brock 
							Lesnar who retained the championship that same night. Building towards this match, Reigns looked to show critics that 
							he can beat Lesnar. Throughout their Wrestlemania match, Lesnar dominated for most part before Reigns made a comeback. 
							Unfortunately, neither men walked out Wrestlemania victorious as Seth Rollins used his Money in The Bank contract to 
							enter this championship match and win the title. 3 years later, Reigns &amp; Lesnar faced off again in the main event 
							of Wrestlemania this time for the Universal Championship. They&apos;re clash went back and forth but ultimately, it 
							would be Lesnar who emerged victorious. The summer that same year, both men faced off at Summerslam &amp; it would be 
							Reigns standing tall as champion.

						<p class="card-text">
							&apos;Authority&excl; a select few have it, while others bow down to it&apos; this was a focus point throughout the rivalry between 
							Roman Reigns &amp; Triple H. Over the course of 2015, Reigns came close to winning the WWE World Heavyweight championship on multiple 
							occasions. Realising Triple H was at the centre of these controversial short comings, Reigns continued to try &amp; capture the 
							championship, being an authority defying figure. At the TLC event later that year, Reigns had an opportunity to win the championship but
							was unsuccessful due to outside interference. The closing moments saw Reigns&apos; anger towards a present at ringside Triple H intensify 
							convinced he had a hand to play in the outcome of this match. Reigns went on to attack and brutalise. Thus, leaving him seriously injured. 
							24 hours later, Reigns had another opportunity to win the championship but this time he would be fired should he fail to win the 
							championship. Reigns overcame the odds and successfully became WWE World Heavyweight champion. At the 2016 Royal Rumble event, Reigns was 
							forced to defend his championship in the traditional 30-man Royal Rumble match. Beginning as the number one entrant, Reigns would face an 
							onslaught of challengers. The number 30 and final entrant saw the return of Triple H since being injured by Reigns back at TLC. 
							Unfortunately, Reigns lost his championship to Triple H who now would main event Wrestlemania. Heading towards Wrestlemania, Reigns earned 
							his place as Triple H&apos;s challenger in the main event. At this point, their rivalry intensified with Triple H brutalising &amp; 
							seriously injuring Reigns. A few weeks later, Reigns returned to exact his revenge on Triple H in a brutal brawl. At Wrestlemania, Reigns 
							would contend with Triple H&apos;s technical ability &amp; devious attempts to retain the championship. But, in the end Reigns emerged 
							victorious &amp; once again champion.

							Ever since Seth Rollins destroyed the 3-man faction known as The Shield, a rivalry grew between Roman Reigns &amp; Randy Orton. During 
							this tragic night, Orton turned his anger towards Reigns following Evolution&apos;s loss to The Shield 2h hours before. Following the 
							events of this night, Reigns &amp; Orton have crossed paths multiple times. From an 8-man ladder match for the vacant WWE World 
							Heavyweight Championship at Money In The Bank, to a fatal 4 way at Battleground again, for the championship this time held by John 
							Cena. 24 hours later, all focus was towards WWE&apos;s biggest event of the summer, Summerslam. The event would feature a WWE World 
							Heavyweight Championship match &amp; Triple H would hand pick Orton as Cena&apos;s challenger. Unfortunately, plans changed when Reigns 
							attacked Orton. Thus, leading to Brock Lesnar becoming Cena&apos;s challenger. Following this, Orton feels Reigns stole his opportunity 
							leading to Reigns suffering a beatdown at Orton&apos;s hand. This would lead onto both men going on to face each other at Summerslam. For 
							both men, this match would focus having the other respect them. Rising to the challenge, Reigns withstood Orton&apos;s onslaught &amp; 
							emerged victorious.
